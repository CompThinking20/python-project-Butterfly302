We just spoke, so I know there are no errors in the code. The issue now is twofold: one, comments. You need to document your code and tell me not just what you're doing but why. The second thing is figuring out how you want the program to react to a user's input: what will be different about the program if I say that my favorite food is pork rather than steak? How is the program going to respond to what a user says or does?
