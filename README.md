  The project I proposed is what is a person favorite foods to eat.
  It took a lot to reach Milestone 1 for me. Considering there were some technical difficulties on my end.
  Milestone two was the same way. I had to figure it out the best way I could until I was able to get a clear session so that I could complete it.
  Yes the concepts from the lectures were useful but still I had issues because we we're in class.
  I was surprised at how easy typing code is. I thought it would be harder than that.
  I would love to learn this in a class setting instead of online.
  I would say remembering what does what was the hardest for me. If i seen what it looks like I can do but for some things I couldn't remember what the action was.
  I feel like I can write in code now. The now I practice the better I will get at it
